[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)
## Question:    
The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the   
range should have the same probability.  
  
Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform?  

## My Answer:  
**Generating the 1000 random values:**  
```{python}
rands = np.random.random(1000)  
len(rands)  
```
Output = 1000 (verifying numbers)  

**Plotting the PMF:**  
```{python}
rands_pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(rands)  
thinkplot.Pmf(rands_pmf, label = 'Random Values')  
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Random Values: 0-1', ylabel='PMF')  
```
**What goes wrong?** Can't tell the difference between any values, it's so close together  

**Plotting the CDF:**  
```python{}
rands_cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(rands)  
thinkplot.Cdf(rands_cdf, label = 'Random Values - CDF')  
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Random Values: 0-1', ylabel='CDF')  
```
**Is this distribution uniform?** Yes, as the CDF is a straight line.
